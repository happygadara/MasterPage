            <p class="contentP">
                You don’t have to be a doctor to save lives, just donate blood. One of the acts of charity that everyone can perform is donation of blood. A small amount of blood can save at least 3 lives. With this noble thought Darshan College, in collaboration with the Indian Red Cross Society organized a blood donation camp. This gave an opportunity to many students, parents and faculty as well, to participate and be the part of saving lives. The blood you donate gives someone another chance at chance. One day that someone may be a close relative, a friend, a loved one or even you.

            <p class="contentP">‘I’ll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it, but I will come for sure’ – Late Captain Vikram Batra. A grateful nation pays homage to all those who served the nation during War. Our brave Soldiers ensured that India remains protected and gave a befitting answer to those who tried to vitiate the atmosphere of peace. We salute the ultimate sacrifice of the martyrs of Kargil. Darshan College NCC Unit organized a tributary event to pay homage to the great Soldiers who fought the Kargil war. Rev. Fr. Vijesh Menezes who was the Chief Guest for the event rightly said that it is not the celebration of war but the celebration of the Victory. The NCC Cadets staged a heart wrenching program reminding everyone present that love for the nation should be in action. Years might fly faster but the memories of Kargil are etched deeper in the hearts of Indian Citizens evoking and inflaming the Spirit of Patriotism.</p>

            <h4 class="h5">Vaccination Drive @ Darshan College</h4>
            <p class="contentP">Vaccines are one of the best things that ever happened in medicines. The Covid 19 Pandemic has created a new normal with social distancing, wearing masks, virtual classes etc. Yet it’s not to be considered as a victory of Corona Virus. The United fight against the deadly virus continues and grows stronger with every awareness program conducted, with every inoculation done. With this motivation, Darshan College organized 3 Vaccination drives with the help and support of Ullal Public Health Centre. The Teaching, Non-Teaching Staff, Students and a few people in the vicinity were vaccinated in the college campus. It was a small step to facilitate the global effort to destabilize the Virus: Be vaccinated, be safe.</p>
